Hi, I'm Oleh and I'm currently working on Subsocial - a web3 social protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem. I enjoy combining both development and product roles as it allows me to build new projects, define their value, understand customer needs, extract the most important features for MVP, and decrease the time for demonstrating proof of concepts.

I hold a master's degree in Cybersecurity and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. In the past, I was as the Lead of the Developer Student Club at the National Aviation University of Ukraine.

I'm a passionate blockchain enthusiast and aspire to become a blockchain scientist in the future. I love finding solutions and creating new products, mentoring young programmers, and sharing my experience. In addition, I also advise a digital student team at a university, which aims to bring digitalization to educational institutions.
