Hi, I'm Oleh, working on Subsocial - a web3 social protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem. I enjoy combining both development and product roles as it allows me to build new projects, define their value, understand customer needs, extract the most important features for MVP, and decrease the time for demonstrating proof of concepts.
